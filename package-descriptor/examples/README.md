# Examples for the Package Descriptor

Contains some working examples of the package descriptor. Each example should have a corresponding test. Thus, each example is tested with every pull request and we can be sure that all the examples are valid (against the current package descriptor schema).

### Simplest Example
The most simple exampe of a package descriptor can be found in *simplest-example.yml*. It only contains the mandatory fields. Closely related is *simplest-example.son* that is the most simple example of a SONATA package. It only contains the mandatory files i.e. the MANIFEST.MF file in the META-INF directory, and - in addtion - a README.md.
