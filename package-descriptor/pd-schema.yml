title: "Package Descriptor Schema"
version: 1.0
description: |
  The package descriptor schema specifies the structure
  of the package descriptor. It makes sure the relevant
  information is provided to parse the package in a
  meaningful way.

##
## Definitions that are re-used later on.
##
## It seems that some (many?) parsers have problems
## parsing the reference to definitions correctly.
## Thus, we ignore definitions for now and insert
## the keys directly at the right places.
##
definitions:
